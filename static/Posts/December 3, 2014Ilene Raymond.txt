<p>I&rsquo;m aware of Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen, Mr. Autry. But Rudolph, I&nbsp;<em>know</em>. He showed me that my power rests in my uniqueness, and that others feel different, too.</p>

<p>This year marks the 50th anniversary of the now-classic holiday stop-motion animation Christmas special&nbsp;<em>Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer</em>. He arrived on the scene a long time before I did, but it&rsquo;s not how long you&rsquo;ve known this little guy that matters. It&rsquo;s a gift to know him at all.</p>

<p>Imagine being the weird kid with her nose always buried in a book, the religion representative to the school for her sixth grade class, and the one who reads Shakespeare on Sundays for fun. No, I&rsquo;m not talking about me. What would make you think that? (By the way, I wore the religion rep badge proudly, further solidifying my weirdness.)</p>

<p>Now imagine that person, in moments when her &ldquo;weirdness&rdquo; made her feel separate from her peers, remembering the story about a reindeer that everyone teases for his red nose &mdash; when it turns out his nose is the only thing that can save Christmas!</p>

<p><strong>The weird, the not-so-weird, and the definitely weird</strong><img alt="" src="http://www.broadstreetreview.com/images/uploads/posts/Rudolph_and_the_gang.jpg" style="border:0px; box-sizing:border-box; float:right; height:404px; margin:15px; width:306px" /></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember my first&nbsp;<em>Rudolph</em>&nbsp;viewing. I do know I&rsquo;ve watched it every year that I can remember. Each year, I proudly display my Rudolph&rsquo;s Christmas Village (one of those monthly collectible clubs offering buildings and characters in hand-painted resin), including Santa&rsquo;s Workshop, Mr. and Mrs. Claus&rsquo;s house, the Reindeer Flight Camp (complete with a red- and green-lighted runway), and Hermey&rsquo;s Dentist Office.</p>

<p>Hermey, you may recall, became best buds with Rudolph on the way to the Island of Misfit Toys (where defective and unwanted toys are sent). Hermey, too, was a weirdo. He didn&rsquo;t want to make toys like the other elves; he wanted to pull and drill teeth. O.K., that is weird; but I support elves&rsquo; rights to be whatever they want to be.</p>

<p><strong>Spotting Rudolph in the wild</strong></p>

<p>As a Philly kid, I loved seeing the light show every year at Wanamaker&rsquo;s&hellip;Lord &amp; Taylor&hellip;Macy&rsquo;s, mostly because Rudolph is featured prominently. And this year, imagine my shouting out with glee when the United States Postal Service issued stamps honoring the show&rsquo;s anniversary. The cutest stamps ever feature the main characters and the Bumble, the abominable snow monster who literally loses his bite (courtesy of Hermey) revealing his true self &mdash; a big ol&rsquo; softie. They&rsquo;ll look so cool on my Rudolph Christmas cards.</p>

<p>I have and do all this because Rudolph is awesome. He&rsquo;s gone down in history because most people can relate. Who hasn&rsquo;t felt, at one time or another, invisible, alone, weird, or like a misfit? It&rsquo;s pretty cool that what&rsquo;s essentially a kid&#39;s&nbsp;show can tell a truly human story (via a reindeer) that resonates with all ages.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll watch the show&rsquo;s 50th anniversary airing next week. I know it by heart, but it&rsquo;s not&nbsp;<em>officially</em>&nbsp;the holidays until the nose glows and Rudolph and I sing some tunes together, including &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a Couple of Misfits.&rdquo; He sings with Hermey, but I always imagine it&rsquo;s me:</p>

<p><em>We may be different from the rest</em></p>

<p><em>Who decides the test of what is really best?...</em></p>

<p><em>What&rsquo;s the matter with misfits?</em></p>

<p><em>That&rsquo;s where we fit in!</em></p>

<p>Thankfully, I found ways to fit in, with my writing and other talents, as I grew up. But I was (and sometimes still am) a misfit. And Rudolph made that O.K. Seems he had other gifts besides his glowing nose.</p>
